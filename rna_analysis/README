# snRNA-seq analysis 

This directory contains several pipelines used for analysis of snRNA-seq data in our paper.

## [`make_seurat_rna`](https://github.com/mcvickerlab/sn_cocaine_rats/tree/master/rna_analysis/make_seurat_rna)
This pipeline takes outputs of [`cellranger-count`](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count#cr-count) and creates Seurat objects for each sample.
